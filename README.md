# AI Accounting Assistant

A privacy-first AI tool designed for accounting teams to automatically detect sensitive information, identify anomalies, and provide instant data insights while maintaining the highest security standards.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Features

- **No Data Storage**: Files are processed in memory and never saved to disk
- **PII Detection & Redaction**: Automatically identifies and redacts SSNs, phone numbers, emails, and account numbers
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your machine - no data sent to external servers
- **Secure by Design**: Built with accounting team privacy requirements in mind

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic PII Detection**
- Social Security Numbers (XXX-XX-XXXX)
- Phone Numbers (various formats)
- Email Addresses
- Account Numbers (8+ digit sequences)

### 2. **Anomaly Detection**
- Duplicate payments to same vendor
- Statistical outliers in transaction amounts
- Negative transaction amounts
- Unusual spending patterns

### 3. **Instant Analytics**
- Summary statistics
- Data visualizations
- Transaction distribution charts
- Real-time processing

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask web framework
- Pandas for data processing
- Matplotlib for visualizations

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-accounting-assistant.git
cd ai-accounting-assistant
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash

```

### Option 2: Cloud Deployment (Recommended for Demo)

Deploy to **Streamlit Cloud**, **Render**, or **Railway** for easy sharing:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect your cloud platform to the repository
3. Deploy with automatic builds
4. Share the live URL with your CAO

## 📊 How to Use

1. **Upload a CSV file** containing accounting data
2. **Review PII Detection** - See what sensitive information was found and redacted
3. **Check Anomaly Results** - Review flagged transactions and unusual patterns
4. **Analyze Data** - View summary statistics and visualizations
5. **Download Results** - Export cleaned data for further analysis

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── app.py                      # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── README.md                   # This file
├── sample_accounting_data.csv  # Test data file
└── templates/

## 🧪 Testing with Sample Data

Use the included `sample_accounting_data.csv` file to test the application. This file contains:

- 20 sample transactions
- Various PII types (emails, phone numbers, account numbers)
- Duplicate payments for testing anomaly detection
- Different transaction amounts for statistical analysis

## 🎯 Use Cases for Accounting Teams

### **For CAOs & Finance Leaders:**
- **Risk Assessment**: Quickly identify potentially fraudulent transactions
- **Compliance**: Ensure PII is properly handled before sharing data
- **Process Improvement**: Spot patterns that indicate process inefficiencies

### **For Accounting Staff:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically redact sensitive information before analysis
- **Audit Preparation**: Flag unusual transactions for review
- **Quality Control**: Identify data entry errors and inconsistencies

### **For External Auditors:**
- **Safe Data Sharing**: Receive pre-cleaned data with PII redacted
- **Anomaly Reporting**: Focus audit attention on flagged transactions
- **Compliance Verification**: Demonstrate proper data handling procedures

## 🔧 Customization Options

The application can be easily customized for specific needs:

- **Add Custom PII Patterns**: Modify the `PIIDetector` class to detect company-specific sensitive data
- **Adjust Anomaly Thresholds**: Tune the statistical outlier detection parameters
- **Custom Visualizations**: Add charts specific to your reporting needs
- **Integration Ready**: API endpoints can be extended for integration with existing systems

## 📈 Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web framework with Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV handling and analysis
- **PII Detection**: Regex-based pattern matching (can be upgraded to ML models)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with modern, responsive design
- **Security**: No persistent storage, in-memory processing only

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### **Free Hosting Options:**
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Perfect for data science demos
- **Render**: Good for Flask applications
- **Railway**: Modern deployment platform
- **Heroku**: Classic PaaS option

### **Enterprise Deployment:**
- Self-hosted on company infrastructure
- Docker containerization available
- Can be integrated with existing authentication systems
- Scalable for large file processing
